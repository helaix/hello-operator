# Alphabetical Test Rule File

This rule file is created to test if the system highlights rule files based on alphabetical ordering.

## Guidelines
- This file should come before complex_rule.mdc alphabetically
- It has a simple metadata configuration
- It should be highlighted if alphabetical ordering is used

## Purpose
This file is used to test the hypothesis that the system selects the first rule file alphabetically when displaying information about agent rules.
