This rule file combines multiple metadata configurations to demonstrate a more complex rule setup.

## Guidelines

2. Include code examples with proper syntax highlighting
3. Keep documentation up-to-date with code changes
4. Use consistent terminology throughout documentation

## Purpose
This file demonstrates a more complex rule file with multiple configuration options.
