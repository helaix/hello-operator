# Glob-Specific Rule File

This rule file includes a metadata header with specific globs, which means it should only be applied to files matching those patterns.

## Guidelines
- These rules apply specifically to JavaScript and TypeScript files
- They are automatically applied to files matching the glob patterns
- They represent best practices for JS/TS development

## Purpose
This file demonstrates a rule file that should only be applied to specific file types based on glob patterns.
