## Task ID
WP-06: Conversation Management Implementation

## Problem Statement
The Gemini Live Interface to CodeGen requires robust conversation state management to maintain context across multiple interactions, handle multi-turn conversations, and provide a natural, coherent user experience. Without proper conversation management, the system would treat each interaction as isolated, losing valuable context and requiring users to repeat information.

## Proposed Implementation
Develop a comprehensive conversation management system that maintains conversation state, tracks context across multiple interactions, and enables natural multi-turn conversations. The implementation will include:

1. Conversation state model using Durable Objects for persistence
2. Context tracking across multiple interactions
3. User session management
4. Message history storage and retrieval
5. Context-aware response generation
6. Conversation metadata management
7. Conversation expiration and cleanup

The implementation will leverage Cloudflare Durable Objects for state persistence and follow functional programming principles with Effect TS. It will provide a clean, type-safe interface for other components to interact with conversation state.

## Components Involved
- Conversation state model
- Durable Objects for persistence
- Session management
- Context tracking
- Message history
- Metadata management
- State synchronization

## Dependencies
- Completed WP-01: Development Environment Setup
- Completed WP-02: Cloudflare Infrastructure Setup
- Completed WP-03: Gemini API Integration
- Understanding of conversation modeling and context management
- Knowledge of state persistence patterns

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Define conversation state data model
- [ ] Implement Durable Object for conversation state persistence
- [ ] Create session management functionality
- [ ] Develop message history storage and retrieval
- [ ] Implement context tracking across interactions
- [ ] Create conversation metadata management
- [ ] Develop context-aware response generation integration
- [ ] Implement conversation expiration and cleanup
- [ ] Create utility functions for conversation operations
- [ ] Develop synchronization mechanisms for concurrent updates
- [ ] Implement error handling and recovery
- [ ] Create logging and monitoring for conversation state
- [ ] Develop unit tests for all components
- [ ] Create integration tests for end-to-end flows
- [ ] Document the conversation management architecture and usage

## Verification Steps
1. Test conversation creation and persistence
2. Verify context maintenance across multiple interactions
3. Test session management with simulated user sessions
4. Validate message history storage and retrieval
5. Verify context-aware response generation
6. Test conversation metadata management
7. Validate conversation expiration and cleanup
8. Verify synchronization under concurrent updates
9. Test error handling and recovery mechanisms
10. Run all unit and integration tests

## Decision Authority
- Independent: Implementation details, data model design, utility functions
- User Input Required: Conversation expiration policies, privacy considerations, data retention policies

## Questions/Uncertainties
### Blocking
- Maximum conversation length and history retention policy need to be defined
- Privacy and data protection requirements need to be clarified

### Non-blocking
- Optimal context representation may evolve based on implementation experience
- Performance characteristics under load will need to be monitored and optimized

## Acceptable Tradeoffs
- Initial focus on functionality over advanced features
- Simplified context representation to start, with more sophisticated models added later
- Basic error recovery initially, with more comprehensive mechanisms added as needed
- Limited optimization in the first implementation, with performance improvements in subsequent iterations

## Status
Not Started

## Notes
The conversation management system is a critical component that directly impacts the user experience. Proper context maintenance is essential for natural, efficient interactions. The implementation should balance the need for comprehensive context with performance considerations, especially for long-running conversations. Clear documentation of the conversation state model will be important for maintainability and future enhancements.
