## Task ID
WP-04: CodeGen API Integration

## Problem Statement
The Gemini Live Interface to CodeGen needs to interact with the CodeGen API to access system functionality, retrieve project status, manage issues, and facilitate agent interactions. This integration must be secure, efficient, and provide a comprehensive interface to all required CodeGen capabilities.

## Proposed Implementation
Develop a robust integration layer with the CodeGen API that handles authentication, request formatting, response parsing, error handling, and provides a clean interface for all required CodeGen operations. The implementation will include:

1. Authentication module for secure API access
2. Client library for CodeGen API interactions
3. Project status retrieval functionality
4. Issue management capabilities (creation, updates, comments)
5. Agent interaction interface
6. Repository access functionality
7. Error handling and retry mechanisms
8. Rate limiting and quota management

The implementation will follow best practices for API integration, including proper error handling, rate limiting, and efficient resource usage. It will provide a type-safe interface that aligns with the Effect TS functional programming approach.

## Components Involved
- Authentication and security
- CodeGen API client library
- Project management interface
- Issue tracking system
- Agent interaction framework
- Repository access module
- Error handling and logging
- Type definitions and interfaces

## Dependencies
- Completed WP-01: Development Environment Setup
- Completed WP-02: Cloudflare Infrastructure Setup
- CodeGen API access credentials
- CodeGen API documentation and specifications
- Understanding of CodeGen's functionality and data models
- Knowledge of project management and issue tracking concepts

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Create authentication module for CodeGen API
- [ ] Implement secure storage of API credentials
- [ ] Develop base client library for CodeGen API requests
- [ ] Create type definitions for API requests and responses
- [ ] Implement project status retrieval functionality
- [ ] Develop issue creation and management capabilities
- [ ] Create comment functionality for issues
- [ ] Implement agent interaction interface
- [ ] Develop repository access functionality
- [ ] Create error handling and retry mechanisms
- [ ] Implement rate limiting and quota management
- [ ] Develop logging and monitoring for API interactions
- [ ] Create utility functions for common operations
- [ ] Implement unit tests for all components
- [ ] Create integration tests for end-to-end flows
- [ ] Document the API integration architecture and usage

## Verification Steps
1. Verify authentication with CodeGen API using test credentials
2. Test project status retrieval with sample projects
3. Validate issue creation and management with test issues
4. Test comment functionality on test issues
5. Verify agent interaction with test agents
6. Test repository access with sample repositories
7. Validate error handling with simulated API failures
8. Verify rate limiting behavior under load
9. Run all unit and integration tests
10. Perform end-to-end testing of the complete integration

## Decision Authority
- Independent: Implementation details, error handling strategies, utility functions
- User Input Required: API credential management, rate limiting policies, data model design

## Questions/Uncertainties
### Blocking
- CodeGen API access and authentication method need to be confirmed
- Complete API documentation and endpoints need to be available

### Non-blocking
- Optimal error handling strategy may evolve based on implementation experience
- Additional API capabilities may be identified during implementation

## Acceptable Tradeoffs
- Initial focus on core functionality over advanced features
- Simplified error handling to start, with more sophisticated recovery mechanisms added later
- Basic logging initially, with more comprehensive monitoring added as needed
- Limited optimization in the first implementation, with performance improvements in subsequent iterations

## Status
Not Started

## Notes
The CodeGen API integration is a central component of the system, as it provides access to the core functionality that users will interact with through the Gemini interface. Proper error handling and clear documentation of the integration will be essential for maintainability and troubleshooting. The type definitions and interfaces should be designed to align with the CodeGen data model while providing a clean, functional interface for the rest of the application.
