## Task ID
WP-03: Gemini API Integration

## Problem Statement
The Gemini Live Interface to CodeGen requires seamless integration with Google's Gemini API to enable natural language processing, speech-to-text, text-to-speech, and function calling capabilities. This integration needs to be robust, efficient, and properly authenticated to ensure reliable communication between the interface and Gemini's AI capabilities.

## Proposed Implementation
Develop a comprehensive integration layer with Gemini API that handles all aspects of communication, including authentication, request formatting, response parsing, error handling, and rate limiting. The implementation will include:

1. Authentication module for secure API access
2. Client library for Gemini API interactions
3. Natural language processing integration for understanding user intents
4. Speech-to-text integration for voice input processing
5. Text-to-speech integration for voice output generation
6. Function calling implementation for structured API interactions
7. Context management for multi-turn conversations
8. Error handling and retry mechanisms

The implementation will follow best practices for API integration, including proper error handling, rate limiting, and efficient resource usage.

## Components Involved
- Authentication and security
- Gemini API client library
- Natural language processing
- Speech-to-text processing
- Text-to-speech generation
- Function calling framework
- Context management
- Error handling and logging

## Dependencies
- Completed WP-01: Development Environment Setup
- Completed WP-02: Cloudflare Infrastructure Setup
- Gemini API key and access credentials
- Gemini API documentation and specifications
- Understanding of natural language processing concepts
- Knowledge of speech processing technologies

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Create authentication module for Gemini API
- [ ] Implement secure storage of API credentials
- [ ] Develop base client library for Gemini API requests
- [ ] Implement natural language understanding integration
- [ ] Create speech-to-text processing module
- [ ] Develop text-to-speech generation module
- [ ] Implement function calling framework
- [ ] Create context management for multi-turn conversations
- [ ] Develop error handling and retry mechanisms
- [ ] Implement rate limiting and quota management
- [ ] Create logging and monitoring for API interactions
- [ ] Develop utility functions for common operations
- [ ] Create type definitions for API requests and responses
- [ ] Implement unit tests for all components
- [ ] Create integration tests for end-to-end flows
- [ ] Document the API integration architecture and usage

## Verification Steps
1. Verify authentication with Gemini API using test credentials
2. Test natural language understanding with sample queries
3. Validate speech-to-text processing with test audio inputs
4. Test text-to-speech generation with sample text
5. Verify function calling with test functions
6. Test context management across multiple conversation turns
7. Validate error handling with simulated API failures
8. Verify rate limiting behavior under load
9. Run all unit and integration tests
10. Perform end-to-end testing of the complete integration

## Decision Authority
- Independent: Implementation details, error handling strategies, utility functions
- User Input Required: API credential management, rate limiting policies, function calling schema design

## Questions/Uncertainties
### Blocking
- Gemini API access and quota limits need to be confirmed
- Function calling capabilities and limitations need to be verified

### Non-blocking
- Optimal context management strategy may evolve based on implementation experience
- Performance characteristics under load will need to be monitored and optimized

## Acceptable Tradeoffs
- Initial focus on core functionality over advanced features
- Simplified error handling to start, with more sophisticated recovery mechanisms added later
- Basic logging initially, with more comprehensive monitoring added as needed
- Limited optimization in the first implementation, with performance improvements in subsequent iterations

## Status
Not Started

## Notes
The Gemini API integration is a critical component of the system, as it provides the AI capabilities that power the interface. Proper error handling and rate limiting are especially important to ensure reliability and prevent quota exhaustion. The function calling implementation will be particularly important for enabling structured interactions with the CodeGen and Linear APIs.
