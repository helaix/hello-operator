## Task ID
WP-07: Voice Interface Implementation

## Problem Statement
The Gemini Live Interface to CodeGen requires a natural and efficient voice interface to enable hands-free interaction with the system. Users need to be able to issue voice commands, receive audio responses, and maintain conversation context through voice interactions, whether in real-time or asynchronously.

## Proposed Implementation
Develop a comprehensive voice interface that handles voice input processing, audio response generation, and integration with the conversation management system. The implementation will include:

1. Voice input capture and processing
2. Speech-to-text conversion using Gemini API
3. Text-to-speech generation for responses
4. Voice command recognition and intent extraction
5. Audio streaming for real-time interactions
6. Asynchronous voice messaging support
7. Integration with conversation management
8. Error handling and recovery for voice interactions

The implementation will leverage Gemini's speech capabilities and provide both real-time and asynchronous voice interaction options. It will integrate seamlessly with the conversation management system to maintain context across interactions.

## Components Involved
- Voice input processing
- Speech-to-text conversion
- Text-to-speech generation
- Voice command recognition
- Audio streaming
- Asynchronous messaging
- Conversation management integration
- Error handling and recovery

## Dependencies

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Implement voice input capture mechanism
- [ ] Create speech-to-text integration with Gemini API
- [ ] Develop text-to-speech generation for responses
- [ ] Implement voice command recognition and intent extraction
- [ ] Create audio streaming for real-time interactions
- [ ] Develop asynchronous voice messaging support
- [ ] Implement integration with conversation management
- [ ] Create error handling and recovery for voice interactions
- [ ] Develop voice-specific context management
- [ ] Implement audio quality optimization
- [ ] Create voice interface configuration options
- [ ] Develop logging and monitoring for voice interactions
- [ ] Implement unit tests for all components
- [ ] Create integration tests for end-to-end flows
- [ ] Document the voice interface architecture and usage

## Verification Steps
1. Test voice input capture with sample audio
2. Verify speech-to-text conversion accuracy
3. Test text-to-speech generation quality
4. Validate voice command recognition with test commands
5. Test audio streaming performance and reliability
6. Verify asynchronous voice messaging functionality
7. Test integration with conversation management
8. Validate error handling with simulated failures
9. Verify voice interface under various network conditions
10. Run all unit and integration tests

## Decision Authority
- Independent: Implementation details, audio processing strategies, error handling
- User Input Required: Voice interface design, command vocabulary, privacy considerations

## Questions/Uncertainties
### Blocking
- Voice quality requirements and minimum acceptable accuracy need to be defined
- Privacy and data protection requirements for voice data need to be clarified

### Non-blocking
- Optimal audio streaming configuration may require adjustment based on testing
- Additional voice commands may be identified during implementation

## Acceptable Tradeoffs
- Initial focus on core voice functionality over advanced features
- Simplified error handling to start, with more sophisticated recovery mechanisms added later
- Basic audio quality initially, with optimizations added as needed
- Limited command vocabulary to start, expanding based on user feedback

## Status
Not Started

## Notes
The voice interface is a key differentiator for the system, enabling hands-free interaction with CodeGen. Particular attention should be paid to the user experience, ensuring that voice interactions feel natural and efficient. The implementation should balance functionality with performance considerations, especially for real-time audio streaming. Privacy considerations for voice data should be carefully addressed in the implementation.
