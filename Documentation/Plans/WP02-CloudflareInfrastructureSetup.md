## Task ID
WP-02: Cloudflare Infrastructure Setup

## Problem Statement
The Gemini Live Interface to CodeGen requires a robust, scalable, and reliable infrastructure to handle real-time communication, maintain conversation state, and process user interactions. Cloudflare Workers and Durable Objects have been selected as the infrastructure solution, but they need to be properly configured and set up.

## Proposed Implementation
Set up a comprehensive Cloudflare infrastructure for the Gemini Live Interface to CodeGen using Cloudflare Workers for serverless functions and Durable Objects for state management. This implementation will include:

1. Wrangler CLI configuration for local development and deployment
2. Cloudflare Workers setup with appropriate routes and environments
3. Durable Objects configuration for conversation and session state management
4. KV storage setup for configuration and settings
5. Deployment workflow for staging and production environments

The implementation will follow Cloudflare best practices and ensure proper error handling, state persistence, and environment configuration.

## Components Involved
- Wrangler CLI and configuration
- Cloudflare Workers
- Cloudflare Durable Objects
- Cloudflare KV Storage
- Deployment and CI/CD pipeline
- Environment configuration management

## Dependencies
- Completed WP-01: Development Environment Setup
- Cloudflare account with Workers and Durable Objects enabled
- Wrangler CLI installed
- Knowledge of Cloudflare Workers and Durable Objects
- Understanding of serverless architecture principles

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Install and authenticate Wrangler CLI
- [ ] Create wrangler.toml configuration file with appropriate settings
- [ ] Configure environment variables for different environments
- [ ] Create worker entry point file with basic routing
- [ ] Define Durable Object classes for conversation and session management
- [ ] Configure Durable Object bindings in wrangler.toml
- [ ] Create migrations for Durable Objects
- [ ] Set up state persistence in Durable Objects
- [ ] Create KV namespace for configuration
- [ ] Configure KV bindings in wrangler.toml
- [ ] Create utility functions for KV access
- [ ] Set up initial configuration values in KV
- [ ] Create deployment scripts for different environments
- [ ] Set up continuous integration for automated testing
- [ ] Configure staging and production environments
- [ ] Create rollback procedures for failed deployments
- [ ] Document the infrastructure setup and configuration

## Verification Steps
1. Run `wrangler dev` to verify local development setup
2. Test Durable Object creation and persistence with sample data
3. Verify KV storage operations with test configuration values
4. Deploy to staging environment and verify functionality
5. Test environment variable configuration across environments
6. Verify worker routes and request handling
7. Test rollback procedures with simulated failure

## Decision Authority
- Independent: Infrastructure configuration details, utility function implementation, local development setup
- User Input Required: Production deployment approval, security configuration, API key management

## Questions/Uncertainties
### Blocking
- Cloudflare account access and permissions need to be confirmed
- Durable Object usage limits need to be verified for the expected load

### Non-blocking
- Optimal Durable Object structure may evolve based on implementation experience
- Additional KV namespaces may be needed as the project evolves

## Acceptable Tradeoffs
- Simplified deployment workflow initially, with more sophisticated CI/CD added later
- Basic error handling to start, with more comprehensive error management added as needed
- Focus on functionality over optimization in the initial implementation

## Status
Not Started

## Notes
The Cloudflare infrastructure setup is critical for the performance and reliability of the system. Proper configuration of Durable Objects is especially important for maintaining conversation state across interactions. Documentation of the infrastructure setup will be essential for maintenance and troubleshooting.
