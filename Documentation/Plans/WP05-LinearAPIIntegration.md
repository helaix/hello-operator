## Task ID
WP-05: Linear API Integration

## Problem Statement
The Gemini Live Interface to CodeGen needs to interact with the Linear API to access project management functionality, retrieve issue information, manage issues, and add comments. This integration must be secure, efficient, and provide a comprehensive interface to all required Linear capabilities.

## Proposed Implementation
Develop a robust integration layer with the Linear API that handles authentication, request formatting, response parsing, error handling, and provides a clean interface for all required Linear operations. The implementation will include:

1. Authentication module for secure API access
2. Client library for Linear API interactions
3. Issue retrieval and search functionality
4. Issue creation and management capabilities
5. Comment functionality for issues
6. User and team information retrieval
7. Error handling and retry mechanisms
8. Rate limiting and quota management

The implementation will follow best practices for API integration, including proper error handling, rate limiting, and efficient resource usage. It will provide a type-safe interface that aligns with the Effect TS functional programming approach.

## Components Involved
- Authentication and security
- Linear API client library
- Issue tracking interface
- Comment management system
- User and team information module
- Error handling and logging
- Type definitions and interfaces

## Dependencies
- Completed WP-01: Development Environment Setup
- Completed WP-02: Cloudflare Infrastructure Setup
- Linear API access credentials
- Linear API documentation and specifications
- Understanding of Linear's functionality and data models
- Knowledge of project management and issue tracking concepts

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Create authentication module for Linear API
- [ ] Implement secure storage of API credentials
- [ ] Develop base client library for Linear API requests
- [ ] Create type definitions for API requests and responses
- [ ] Implement issue retrieval and search functionality
- [ ] Develop issue creation and management capabilities
- [ ] Create comment functionality for issues
- [ ] Implement user and team information retrieval
- [ ] Develop error handling and retry mechanisms
- [ ] Implement rate limiting and quota management
- [ ] Create logging and monitoring for API interactions
- [ ] Develop utility functions for common operations
- [ ] Implement unit tests for all components
- [ ] Create integration tests for end-to-end flows
- [ ] Document the API integration architecture and usage

## Verification Steps
1. Verify authentication with Linear API using test credentials
2. Test issue retrieval and search with sample issues
3. Validate issue creation and management with test issues
4. Test comment functionality on test issues
5. Verify user and team information retrieval
6. Validate error handling with simulated API failures
7. Verify rate limiting behavior under load
8. Run all unit and integration tests
9. Perform end-to-end testing of the complete integration

## Decision Authority
- Independent: Implementation details, error handling strategies, utility functions
- User Input Required: API credential management, rate limiting policies, data model design

## Questions/Uncertainties
### Blocking
- Linear API access and authentication method need to be confirmed
- Complete API documentation and endpoints need to be available

### Non-blocking
- Optimal error handling strategy may evolve based on implementation experience
- Additional API capabilities may be identified during implementation

## Acceptable Tradeoffs
- Initial focus on core functionality over advanced features
- Simplified error handling to start, with more sophisticated recovery mechanisms added later
- Basic logging initially, with more comprehensive monitoring added as needed
- Limited optimization in the first implementation, with performance improvements in subsequent iterations

## Status
Not Started

## Notes
The Linear API integration is an important component of the system, as it provides access to project management functionality that users will interact with through the Gemini interface. Proper error handling and clear documentation of the integration will be essential for maintainability and troubleshooting. The type definitions and interfaces should be designed to align with the Linear data model while providing a clean, functional interface for the rest of the application.
