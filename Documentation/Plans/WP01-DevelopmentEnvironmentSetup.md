## Task ID
WP-01: Development Environment Setup

## Problem Statement
The Gemini Live Interface to CodeGen project requires a properly configured development environment and project structure to ensure efficient development, consistent code quality, and proper integration of all components.

## Proposed Implementation
Set up a comprehensive development environment for the Gemini Live Interface to CodeGen project using TypeScript with Effect TS. This implementation will include:

1. A properly configured TypeScript project with appropriate settings for Effect TS
2. Code quality tools including ESLint and Prettier
3. A testing framework with Jest
4. A structured project directory layout that follows the architecture design
5. Build pipeline configuration for development and production environments

The implementation will follow functional programming principles and establish clear separation of concerns in the project structure.

## Components Involved
- TypeScript configuration and build system
- Effect TS library and configuration
- Code quality tools (ESLint, Prettier)
- Testing framework (Jest)
- Project structure and organization
- Documentation system

## Dependencies
- Node.js and npm installed on the development machine
- Knowledge of TypeScript and Effect TS
- Understanding of functional programming principles
- Familiarity with ESLint and Prettier configuration
- Experience with Jest testing framework

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Initialize npm project with appropriate configuration
- [ ] Install and configure TypeScript with settings for Effect TS
- [ ] Install and configure Effect TS
- [ ] Set up ESLint and Prettier for code quality
- [ ] Configure Jest for testing TypeScript code
- [ ] Create sample test to verify testing setup
- [ ] Establish project directory structure according to architecture
- [ ] Configure build scripts in package.json
- [ ] Set up bundling for Cloudflare Workers
- [ ] Create development and production build configurations
- [ ] Create README.md with project overview and setup instructions
- [ ] Document the development environment setup process

## Verification Steps
1. Run `npm install` to verify dependency installation
2. Execute `npm run build` to verify TypeScript compilation
3. Run `npm run lint` to verify ESLint configuration
4. Execute `npm run format` to verify Prettier configuration
5. Run `npm test` to verify Jest testing setup
6. Verify that the project structure matches the specified architecture
7. Confirm that the README.md contains clear setup instructions

## Decision Authority
- Independent: Project structure organization, code style configuration, testing approach
- User Input Required: Major architectural decisions, technology stack changes, deployment configuration

## Questions/Uncertainties
### Blocking
- None for this workplan

### Non-blocking
- Optimal TypeScript configuration for Effect TS may require adjustment based on implementation experience
- Additional development dependencies may be identified during implementation

## Acceptable Tradeoffs
- Simplified testing setup initially, with more comprehensive tests added later
- Basic ESLint/Prettier configuration to start, with more specific rules added as needed
- Initial focus on developer experience over optimization

## Status
Not Started

## Notes
The development environment setup is the foundation for all subsequent workplans. A clean, well-organized structure will facilitate faster development and easier maintenance. Documentation of the setup process is crucial for onboarding additional developers.
