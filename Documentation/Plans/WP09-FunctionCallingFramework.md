## Task ID
WP-09: Function Calling Framework

## Problem Statement
The Gemini Live Interface to CodeGen requires a robust function calling framework to enable structured interactions with external APIs (CodeGen, Linear) based on natural language inputs. Without this framework, the system would be unable to translate user intents into specific API actions, limiting its functionality and usefulness.

## Proposed Implementation
Develop a comprehensive function calling framework that maps natural language intents to specific API functions, handles parameter extraction, manages function execution, and processes results. The implementation will include:

1. Function registry for available API functions
2. Intent-to-function mapping system
3. Parameter extraction and validation
4. Function execution management
5. Result processing and formatting
6. Error handling and recovery
7. Function calling schema definition
8. Logging and monitoring

The implementation will leverage Gemini's function calling capabilities and provide a clean, type-safe interface for registering and executing functions. It will integrate with the CodeGen and Linear API integrations to enable a wide range of operations through natural language.

## Components Involved

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Define function calling schema structure
- [ ] Implement function registry for available API functions
- [ ] Create intent-to-function mapping system
- [ ] Develop parameter extraction and validation
- [ ] Implement function execution management
- [ ] Create result processing and formatting
- [ ] Develop error handling and recovery
- [ ] Implement logging and monitoring
- [ ] Create utility functions for common operations
- [ ] Register CodeGen API functions
- [ ] Register Linear API functions
- [ ] Develop unit tests for all components
- [ ] Create integration tests for end-to-end flows
- [ ] Document the function calling framework architecture and usage
- [ ] Create developer guide for adding new functions

## Verification Steps
1. Test function registration with sample functions
2. Verify intent-to-function mapping with test intents
3. Test parameter extraction with sample inputs
4. Validate function execution with test functions
5. Verify result processing and formatting
6. Test error handling with simulated failures
7. Validate logging and monitoring
8. Test integration with CodeGen API functions
9. Test integration with Linear API functions
10. Run all unit and integration tests

## Decision Authority
- Independent: Implementation details, schema structure, error handling
- User Input Required: Function definitions, intent mapping strategies, result formatting

## Questions/Uncertainties
### Blocking
- Complete list of required functions needs to be defined
- Gemini's function calling capabilities and limitations need to be verified

### Non-blocking
- Optimal intent mapping strategy may evolve based on implementation experience
- Additional utility functions may be identified during implementation

## Acceptable Tradeoffs
- Initial focus on core functionality over advanced features
- Simplified error handling to start, with more sophisticated recovery mechanisms added later
- Limited function set initially, expanding based on user needs
- Basic result formatting to start, with more advanced options added as needed

## Status
Not Started

## Notes
The function calling framework is a critical component that enables the system to take concrete actions based on natural language inputs. The implementation should be flexible enough to accommodate a wide range of functions while providing a consistent interface for function registration and execution. Proper error handling is especially important to ensure that function execution failures are handled gracefully and communicated clearly to users.
