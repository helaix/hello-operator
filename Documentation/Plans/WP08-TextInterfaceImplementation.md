## Task ID
WP-08: Text Interface Implementation

## Problem Statement
The Gemini Live Interface to CodeGen requires a responsive and intuitive text interface to enable efficient text-based interaction with the system. Users need to be able to send text commands, receive formatted text responses, and maintain conversation context through text interactions across multiple platforms.

## Proposed Implementation
Develop a comprehensive text interface that handles text input processing, formatted response generation, and integration with the conversation management system. The implementation will include:

1. Text input processing and normalization
2. Natural language understanding using Gemini API
3. Formatted text response generation
4. Rich text element support (links, code blocks, etc.)
5. Multi-platform text interaction support
6. Integration with conversation management
7. Suggestion buttons for common follow-up actions
8. Error handling and recovery for text interactions

The implementation will leverage Gemini's natural language capabilities and provide a consistent experience across different platforms. It will integrate seamlessly with the conversation management system to maintain context across interactions.

## Components Involved
- Text input processing
- Natural language understanding
- Formatted response generation
- Rich text element support
- Multi-platform integration
- Conversation management integration
- Suggestion system
- Error handling and recovery

## Dependencies
- Completed WP-01: Development Environment Setup
- Completed WP-02: Cloudflare Infrastructure Setup

- Understanding of natural language processing
- Knowledge of text interface design principles

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Implement text input processing and normalization
- [ ] Create natural language understanding integration with Gemini API
- [ ] Develop formatted text response generation
- [ ] Implement rich text element support
- [ ] Create multi-platform text interaction support
- [ ] Develop integration with conversation management
- [ ] Implement suggestion buttons for common follow-up actions
- [ ] Create error handling and recovery for text interactions
- [ ] Develop text-specific context management
- [ ] Implement response formatting optimization
- [ ] Create text interface configuration options
- [ ] Develop logging and monitoring for text interactions
- [ ] Implement unit tests for all components
- [ ] Create integration tests for end-to-end flows
- [ ] Document the text interface architecture and usage

## Verification Steps
1. Test text input processing with sample messages
2. Verify natural language understanding accuracy
3. Test formatted response generation
4. Validate rich text element support
5. Test multi-platform integration
6. Verify integration with conversation management
7. Test suggestion button functionality
8. Validate error handling with simulated failures
9. Verify text interface under various network conditions
10. Run all unit and integration tests

## Decision Authority
- Independent: Implementation details, formatting strategies, error handling
- User Input Required: Text interface design, response formatting, platform integration

## Questions/Uncertainties
### Blocking
- Specific platforms for text integration need to be confirmed
- Response formatting requirements need to be defined

### Non-blocking
- Optimal suggestion button implementation may require adjustment based on testing
- Additional formatting options may be identified during implementation

## Acceptable Tradeoffs
- Initial focus on core text functionality over advanced features
- Simplified error handling to start, with more sophisticated recovery mechanisms added later
- Basic formatting initially, with more advanced options added as needed
- Limited platform integrations to start, expanding based on user needs

## Status
Not Started

## Notes
The text interface provides an essential alternative to voice interaction, especially in situations where voice is not practical or preferred. The implementation should ensure a consistent experience with the voice interface while leveraging the unique capabilities of text communication, such as rich formatting and persistent visibility. Particular attention should be paid to response formatting to ensure clarity and readability across different platforms.
