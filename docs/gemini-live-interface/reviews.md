## 5. Manual Review Process
### 5.1 Pull Request Process
1. Developer creates a branch for their work
2. Developer implements the changes according to the workplan
3. Developer runs automated tests and linting locally
4. Developer creates a pull request with a detailed description
5. CI/CD pipeline runs automated checks
6. Reviewers are assigned to the pull request
7. Reviewers provide feedback
8. Developer addresses feedback
9. Reviewers approve the pull request
10. Pull request is merged

### 5.2 Review Assignment
- Assign at least two reviewers to each pull request
- Include domain experts for specialized components
- Rotate reviewers to spread knowledge
- Consider workload when assigning reviews

### 5.3 Review Timeframe
- Reviews should be completed within 24 hours
- Critical fixes should be reviewed within 4 hours
- If a reviewer is unavailable, reassign the review
- Schedule dedicated review time for large changes

### 5.4 Review Guidelines
- Be respectful and constructive
- Focus on the code, not the person
- Provide specific, actionable feedback
- Explain the reasoning behind suggestions
- Acknowledge good practices and improvements
- Ask questions rather than making assumptions
- Consider the context and constraints
- Prioritize feedback (critical, major, minor)

## 6. Review Feedback Format
### 6.1 Comment Structure
- **Location**: Specific file and line number
- **Type**: Critical, Major, Minor, Question, or Praise
- **Description**: Clear explanation of the issue or suggestion
- **Rationale**: Why this is important
- **Suggestion**: Proposed solution or alternative
- **Examples**: Code examples if applicable

### 6.2 Example Comments
#### 6.2.1 Critical Issue
```
File: src/api/gemini.ts, Line 45
Type: Critical
Description: API key is hardcoded in the source code
Rationale: This is a security risk as the API key could be exposed
Suggestion: Move the API key to environment variables or a secure configuration store
Example: 
const apiKey = process.env.GEMINI_API_KEY;
if (!apiKey) {
  throw new Error('GEMINI_API_KEY environment variable is required');
}
```

#### 6.2.2 Major Issue
```
File: src/state/conversation.ts, Line 78
Type: Major
Description: Conversation state is not properly persisted
Rationale: This could lead to loss of context between interactions
Suggestion: Use Durable Objects to persist the state as specified in the architecture document
Example:
export class ConversationDO implements DurableObject {
  private state: DurableObjectState;
  private conversation: Conversation | null = null;

  constructor(state: DurableObjectState) {
    this.state = state;
  }

  async fetch(request: Request): Promise<Response> {
    // Handle conversation operations
  }
}
```

#### 6.2.3 Minor Issue
```
File: src/utils/formatting.ts, Line 23
Type: Minor
Description: Inconsistent naming convention
Rationale: This makes the code harder to read and maintain
Suggestion: Use camelCase for all function names
Example: Change `format_response` to `formatResponse`
```

#### 6.2.4 Question
```
File: src/interfaces/voice.ts, Line 56
Type: Question
Description: Why is the voice processing done synchronously?
Rationale: This could block the main thread and affect performance
Suggestion: Consider using asynchronous processing with async/await
```

#### 6.2.5 Praise
```
File: src/api/linear.ts, Line 34-67
Type: Praise
Description: Excellent error handling and retry logic
Rationale: This makes the API integration more robust and reliable
```
