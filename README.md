# Gemini Live Interface to CodeGen

This repository contains the comprehensive documentation for implementing a Gemini Live Interface to CodeGen, which provides a voice and text interface for interacting with CodeGen through natural language conversations.

## Overview

The Gemini Live Interface to CodeGen allows users to:
- Check project and task status via voice or text
- Create and manage issues through natural language
- Get audio reports on project progress
- Interact with CodeGen's functionality through conversation

## Documentation Structure

This repository follows a structured approach to software development with the following documents:

1. **[Product Requirements Document (PRD)](docs/gemini-live-interface/product-requirements-document.md)**: Defines what we're building and why
2. **[Architecture Document](docs/gemini-live-interface/architecture-document.md)**: Defines how we'll build it
3. **[UX/UI Plan](docs/gemini-live-interface/uxui-plan.md)**: Defines the user experience and interface
4. **[Project Overview](docs/gemini-live-interface/project-overview.md)**: Breaks down the project into implementable chunks
5. **[Workplans](docs/gemini-live-interface/workplans.md)**: Provides detailed implementation instructions
6. **[Rules](docs/gemini-live-interface/rules.md)**: Defines AI assistant rules and prompts
7. **[Spikes](docs/gemini-live-interface/spikes.md)**: Outlines investigative tasks to evaluate implementation approaches
8. **[Reviews](docs/gemini-live-interface/reviews.md)**: Establishes the review process for quality assurance

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: TypeScript with Effect TS, React (if applicable)
- **Backend**: TypeScript with Effect TS, Cloudflare Workers, Durable Objects
- **APIs**: Gemini API, CodeGen API, Linear API
- **Storage**: Cloudflare KV, Durable Objects

## Implementation Timeline

The project is designed to be implemented within a 24-hour timeline:
- Hours 0-8: Foundation (environment setup, core infrastructure)
- Hours 8-16: Core Functionality (voice/text processing, API integration)
- Hours 16-20: User Interface (voice/text interfaces, response generation)
- Hours 20-24: Testing and Refinement (testing, optimization, deployment)

## Getting Started

To get started with this project:
